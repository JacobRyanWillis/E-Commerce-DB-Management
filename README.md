# E-COMMERCE-DB-MANAGEMENT

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to be able to get more familiar with NPM's such as: Sequelize, express, and MYSQL. I have a much better understanding of routes, Models, files structure for bigger projects, and databases. I learned how to manipulate the database using insomnia to make GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests(CRUD). It is always interesting to learn newer methods on how to handle back end development.
